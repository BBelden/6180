                            Project 6
                            Fall 2017
    

turnin code:  sdd_p6


Build both the client and server sides of a web-based app that provides
your p5 alignment program as a service.  The client side should support 
drag-and-drop a file of a pair of strings onto a dropzone on a web page.

The client should use websockets to transfer the strings to node-based
server that runs your alignment program and sends the results back to
be displayed by the client.

The server should be built using nodejs and should use websockets to
receive a pair of strings to be aligned.  It should drive a new process
that executes the alignment program, and feed the strings to it via 
its stdin, and should capture its stdout, and transfer the result to the
client running in a browser.


To build the project, I will:
    un-tar your project and put it into a dir
    cd to the dir containing your project
    rm -rf p6
    rm -f  *.o
    make
The make step should build your alignment program and do any additional
setup that your project requires.


To run the project:
    in window:
        python3 -m http.server --cgi 5994 &   ## use one of my rbutler ports
        node p6server.js                      ## should use one of your ports

    in a browser:
        visit location:
            www.cs.mtsu.edu:5994    # presents me a list of files
        click to load your page:
            p6client.html
        drag a file onto your marked dropzone, and view the results
