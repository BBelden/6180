# 6180

## this course discussed various elements of software design and development.

**p1** contains programs and files to create a multi-layer neural network that only performs forward propagation.

**p2** contains programs and files to enhance p1 with back-propagation, training, and prediction.

**p3** contains programs and files to that determines satisfiability for a set of propositional clauses.

**p4** contains programs and files to that determines satisfiability for a set of propositional clauses like p3, but restricted to the use of PROLOG only.

**p5** contains programs and files that align a given pair of strings using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm.

**p6** contains programs and files that build both the client and server sides of a web-based app that provides the p5 alignment program as a service.
